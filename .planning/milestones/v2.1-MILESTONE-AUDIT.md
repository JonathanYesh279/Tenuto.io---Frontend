# v2.1 Milestone Audit: Production-Grade Visual Identity

**Audited:** 2026-02-18T21:45:00Z
**Status:** gaps_found
**Milestone Goal:** Drastic visual redesign — transform Tenuto.io from a styled admin template into a production-grade SaaS product completely unrecognizable from v2.0. Light sidebar, multi-color pastel palette, 3-column dashboard, hero stat zones, data-dominant tables, and structured forms.

## Requirements Coverage

### Satisfied (31/39)

| Requirement | Phase | Evidence |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| TOKEN-01: Surface elevation scale (4 levels) | 16 | `--surface-base/raised/overlay/floating` in `:root` |
| TOKEN-02: Warm neutral 9-step color scale | 16 | `--neutral-50` through `--neutral-900` in `:root` |
| TOKEN-03: Semantic shadow scale (5 levels) | 16 | `--shadow-0` through `--shadow-4` with warm rgba values |
| TOKEN-04: Motion preset tokens | 16 | `motionTokens.ts` exports snappy, smooth, bouncy presets |
| COLOR-02: Supporting surfaces use neutral scale | 18 | Entity pastels + neutral bg (210 17% 98%) replace coral tints |
| COLOR-03: Badge components broader color palette | 18/20 | Entity-colored badges (violet, sky, amber) not uniform coral |
| COLOR-04: Detail page gradient headers deeper colors | 21 | Entity-colored pastel headers replace generic coral gradient |
| SURF-01: Sidebar/header/content distinct elevation | 18 | White sidebar, white+border header, cool-gray content |
| SURF-02: Cards use warm-tinted box-shadows | 17 | shadow-1 on Card, shadow-2 on hover |
| SURF-03: Modal/overlay elevated above page | 17 | shadow-4 on Dialog, spring entrance |
| DENS-01: Table rows compact density (40-44px) | 20 | `px-4 py-3` in Table.tsx (~25% density increase) |
| DENS-02: List page spacing tighter | 20 | Dense tables, compact toolbars, hero-aware maxHeight |
| DENS-03: Form/detail pages maintain breathing room | 21 | Accent bar sections with mb-8 spacing between groups |
| DENS-04: List pages defined toolbar zone | 20 | Compact filter toolbar below hero on all 3 list pages |
| MOTN-01: Buttons spring hover/press feedback | 17 | whileTap scale 0.95 via snappy preset on Button |
| MOTN-02: List pages staggered entrance | 20 | ListPageHero stagger with Y-axis variants |
| MOTN-03: Modal spring physics | 17 | Dialog spring entrance via smooth preset |
| MOTN-04: All directional animations RTL-safe | 19/20 | Y-axis only (no unguarded X-axis) in all variants |
| PERS-01: Section headers distinctive styling | 21 | Entity-colored accent bars on form sections |
| PERS-02: Status/instrument badges custom branded | 20 | Entity-colored status badges, avatar initials |
| PERS-04: Section dividers visual rhythm | 21 | Accent bar → heading → field group rhythm in forms |
| PERS-05: Recognizable visual landmarks | 18-21 | Entity pastels, hero zones, accent bars = "Tenuto identity" |
| COMP-01: Consistent page scaffolding | 20 | Hero → toolbar → content on all list pages |
| COMP-02: Vertical spacing between sections follows rules | 20/21 | Consistent spacing patterns across pages |
| COMP-03: Card layouts follow grid standards | 19/20 | Stat card grids with consistent gap/padding |
| COMP-04: All entity pages same structural template | 20/21 | List + detail + form patterns consistent across 3 entities |
| NAV-01: Sidebar stronger visual grouping | 18 | Grouped navigation with MENU/OTHER category labels |
| NAV-02: Active page state unmistakable | 18 | Soft violet pill + font-semibold active state |
| DATA-01: Primary data values stronger emphasis | 19/20 | text-4xl stat numbers, bold entity names in tables |
| DATA-02: Metadata muted styling | 20 | Smaller, muted secondary text consistently |
| PERS-03: Empty states branded personality | 8 (v2.0) | EmptyState component exists from Phase 8 with branded treatment |

### Partially Satisfied (4/39)

| Requirement | Phase | Gap |
|-------------|-------|-----|
| TOKEN-05: Dual color system reconciled | 16 | Inventory created (COLOR-INVENTORY.md) but 1,211 primary-NNN instances remain unmigrated |
| COLOR-01: Coral restricted to CTAs/nav/focus only | 18 | Entity color system created, but primary-NNN coral still used broadly across 134 files |
| MOTN-05: useReducedMotion() guards | 17 | Phase 17 primitives guarded; Phase 19/20 stagger animations (4 files) unguarded |
| SURF-04: Surface zone transitions feel layered | 21 | Layout zones are visually distinct but no explicit transition/animation between zones |

### Unsatisfied (4/39)

| Requirement | Phase | Reason |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| TYPO-01: 6 semantic typography tokens defined | 18 | No typography token module or CSS vars created. Phase 18 pivoted to layout shell + color system reset |
| TYPO-02: Page headings Heebo 700-800 with confident sizing | 18 | Ad-hoc font weights used per component. No systematic heading scale applied |
| TYPO-03: UI body text tighter sizing vs v2.0 | 18 | Only table density addressed (Phase 20). No systematic body text size reduction |
| TYPO-04: Deliberate vertical spacing rhythm tokenized | 18 | Ad-hoc spacing used per component. No spacing rhythm tokens or scale defined |

**Note:** The TYPO-01 through TYPO-04 requirements were mapped to Phase 18, which was originally named "Typography Scale and Color Evolution." During detailed planning, Phase 18 pivoted to "Layout Shell and Color System Reset" to support the SchoolHub-style visual transformation. The typography work was implicitly descoped in favor of the layout/color foundation that enabled Phases 19-21.

| Phase 16 shadow utilities → tailwind.config.js | WIRED |
| Phase 16/18 tokens preserved after Phase 18 additions | WIRED |
| Phase 18 entity colors → Phase 19 Dashboard stat cards | WIRED |
| Phase 18 entity colors → Phase 20 ListPageHero | WIRED |
| Phase 18 entity colors → Phase 20 table avatars | WIRED |
| Phase 18 entity colors → Phase 21 DetailPageHeader | WIRED |

### Orphaned (3/21)

| Connection | Issue |
|------------|-------|
| Phase 21 TeacherForm.tsx accent bars | Component exists (6 sections) but no page/modal imports it. Edit routes through AddTeacherModal (inline form). |
| Phase 21 StudentForm.tsx accent bars | Component exists (4 sections) but Students.tsx imports `forms/StudentForm` (different file, no accent bars). |
| Phase 16 motionTokens.ts bouncy preset | Exported but never imported by any consumer. |

## E2E Flow Verification

| # | Flow | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Admin → sidebar → Dashboard → stat cards + widgets | COMPLETE | White sidebar, 3-column grid, 6 entity-colored cards, calendar/events/activity widgets |
| 2 | Admin → Teachers list → sky hero → filter → dense table | COMPLETE | ListPageHero, compact toolbar, AvatarInitials, icon-only actions |
| 3 | Admin → Teacher detail → sky header → entity tab pills | COMPLETE | DetailPageHeader, 5 entity-colored active tabs |
| 4 | Admin → edit teacher → accent bar form sections | BROKEN | Edit routes through AddTeacherModal (inline form), TeacherForm.tsx accent bars unreachable |
| 5 | Admin → edit student → accent bar form sections | BROKEN | Students.tsx imports `forms/StudentForm` (no accent bars), not `components/StudentForm.tsx` |
| 6 | Admin → edit orchestra → accent bar form sections | COMPLETE | OrchestraForm imported correctly by Orchestras.tsx, 3 sections with amber accent bars |

**Also tested:** Reduced-motion flow is PARTIAL — Phase 17 primitives respect `useReducedMotion()` but Phase 19/20 stagger animations do not.

---

## Tech Debt Summary

| Phase | Items | Severity |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 16 | 1,211 primary-NNN dual-color instances unmigrated; bouncy preset unused | Low |
| 19 | Dashboard stagger uses inline spring params (not motionTokens); missing useReducedMotion | Medium |
| 20 | ListPageHero + 2 widgets missing useReducedMotion; pre-existing TS errors | Medium |
| 21 | TeacherForm orphaned; StudentForm wrong import path | High |

**Total: 9 items across 4 phases**

## Milestone Goal Assessment

The **evolved milestone goal** (SchoolHub-style visual transformation) was achieved:
- Light sidebar with grouped navigation
- Multi-color pastel entity system (6 entities with bg/fg pairs)
- 3-column dashboard with entity-colored stat cards and widget sidebar
- Hero stat zones on all list pages
- Data-dominant tables with avatars, colored badges, icon actions
- Entity-colored detail page headers with tab pills
- Structured forms with visual section groups (OrchestraForm only — Teacher/Student orphaned)

The app is visually unrecognizable from v2.0, matching the primary intent.

**However**, 4 original requirements (TYPO-01 through TYPO-04) were not implemented because Phase 18 pivoted scope, and 2 form restructuring deliverables are not reachable by users due to component import issues.
