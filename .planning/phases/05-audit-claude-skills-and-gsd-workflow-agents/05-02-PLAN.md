<objective>
Fix all stale documentation across CLAUDE.md, PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, and ROADMAP.md so they accurately reflect current project state.

Purpose: Eliminate misleading stale information that wastes Claude context on every session start. Establish single source of truth principle.
Output: Four updated documents with accurate status information.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Fix CLAUDE.md — remove stale status, keep stable instructions</name>
  <files>CLAUDE.md</files>
  <action>
    Per user decision: "CLAUDE.md should be split: stable project instructions only, status/progress lives elsewhere."

    Update the "Current State (What Needs Work)" section in CLAUDE.md:

    1. Mark F3-F6 as `[x]` (complete) — they are ALL done per STATE.md and MEMORY.md
    2. Update F3 description: remove "No multi-tenant login" — it's implemented
    3. Update F4 description: remove "missing" language — forms are built
    4. Update F5 description: remove "No Ministry Reports" — pages are built
    5. Update F6 description: remove negation — polish is done
    6. Add a note at the bottom: "For current progress, see `.planning/STATE.md`"
    7. Update apiService.js line count from ~4800 to ~5200 (actual current size)
    8. Rename section from "Current State (What Needs Work)" to "Implementation Status" since everything is done

    Do NOT change:
    - "First Thing Every Session" section (still valid — implementation guide is good reference)
    - "Related Repositories" section (keep as-is)
    - "Commit Workflow" section (still valid)
    - "CI Pipeline Maintenance" section (still valid)
    - "Memory System" section (still valid)
    - "Key Frontend Patterns" section (keep, just fix line count)

    Run: `grep -c '\[ \]' CLAUDE.md` — should return 0 (no unchecked boxes)
    Run: `grep -c '\[x\]' CLAUDE.md` — should return 6 (F1-F6 all checked)
    Run: `grep 'STATE.md' CLAUDE.md` — should find reference to STATE.md
    Run: `grep '5200' CLAUDE.md` — should find updated line count
  </verify>
  <done>
    CLAUDE.md has all 6 phases marked complete, no stale "needs work" language, references STATE.md for current progress, correct apiService line count.

    **PROJECT.md fixes:**
    1. Fix backend path: Change `/mnt/c/Projects/conservatory-app/Backend` to `/mnt/c/Users/yona2/Documents/Tenuto.io/Tenuto.io-Backend` in the Context section
    2. Move all "Active" requirements to "Validated" — they are ALL complete:
       - Delete demo pages ✓ (Phase 1)
       - Fix ProtectedRoute role mapping ✓ (Phase 1)
       - Sync backend instruments ✓ (Phase 2)
       - Build Audit Trail page ✓ (Phase 3)
       - Polish MinistryReports ✓ (Phase 4)
    3. Update Constraints section: Remove "Backend instruments: Backend validation only accepts 19 instruments — needs sync to 27" — this is fixed (Phase 2)
    4. Update Key Decisions table: apiService.js size from ~4800 to ~5200
    5. Update "Last updated" timestamp to 2026-02-14

    **REQUIREMENTS.md fixes:**
    1. Mark ALL v1.1 requirements as `[x]` (complete) — Phases 1-4 are done:
       - CLN-01, CLN-02, AUTH-01 (Phase 1)
       - DATA-01 (Phase 2)
       - AUDIT-01 through AUDIT-04 (Phase 3)
       - RPT-01 through RPT-04 (Phase 4)
    2. Update Traceability table: Change all 12 statuses from "Pending" to "Complete"
    3. Update "Last updated" timestamp

    **ROADMAP.md fixes:**
    1. Add completion markers to Phases 1-4 titles or success criteria sections
    2. For each of Phases 1-4, add a status line: `**Status:** Complete`
    3. Update Phase 5 success criteria from TBD to actual criteria:
       - No duplicate files between .agents/ and .claude/skills/
       - No stale status references in documentation
       - Architecture document exists
       - Audit report with verifiable pass/fail criteria
    4. Add plan list to Phase 5:
       ```
       Plans:
       - [ ] 05-01-PLAN.md — Delete dead/duplicate files, create audit report
       - [ ] 05-02-PLAN.md — Fix stale documentation across 4 files
       - [ ] 05-03-PLAN.md — Consolidate MEMORY.md, create ARCHITECTURE.md
       ```
    5. Update "Last updated" timestamp
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run: `grep -c "conservatory-app/Backend" .planning/PROJECT.md` — should return 0 (old path removed)
    Run: `grep "Tenuto.io-Backend" .planning/PROJECT.md` — should find correct path
    Run: `grep -c "Pending" .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` — should return 0
    Run: `grep -c "Complete" .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` — should return 12 or more
    Run: `grep "Status.*Complete" .planning/ROADMAP.md | wc -l` — should return 4 (Phases 1-4)
  </verify>
  <done>
    PROJECT.md has correct backend path and no stale Active requirements. REQUIREMENTS.md shows all 12 requirements as Complete. ROADMAP.md shows Phases 1-4 as completed with Phase 5 planned.
  </done>
</task>

1. `grep -c '\[ \]' CLAUDE.md` returns 0
2. `grep 'Tenuto.io-Backend' .planning/PROJECT.md` matches
3. All 12 REQUIREMENTS.md entries show Complete status
4. ROADMAP.md Phases 1-4 have completion markers
5. No file references the old `/mnt/c/Projects/conservatory-app/Backend` path
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All stale status information corrected across 4 documentation files
- Backend path is correct everywhere
- Completed work is properly marked as complete
- Single source of truth principle: status files reference STATE.md
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/05-audit-claude-skills-and-gsd-workflow-agents/05-02-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
