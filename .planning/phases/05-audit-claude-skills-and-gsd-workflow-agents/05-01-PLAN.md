<objective>
Audit the `.claude/` ecosystem, delete dead/duplicate/irrelevant files, and produce the audit report.

Purpose: Remove redundancy and irrelevant config from the project, document findings for transparency.
Output: Audit report + cleaned `.claude/` and `.agents/` directories.

    Delete the following with `rm -rf`:

    1. **`.agents/` directory** (entire tree) — This is an UNTRACKED duplicate of a subset of `.claude/skills/`. Contains byte-identical copies of `component-refactoring/` and `ui-ux-pro-max/` that already exist in `.claude/skills/`. Confirmed identical via `diff -rq`.

    2. **`.claude/skills/component-refactoring/`** (entire directory including references/) — This skill is written for the "Dify frontend" project, not Tenuto.io. It references `pnpm analyze-component`, `pnpm refactor-component`, and Dify-specific paths (`web/app/components/`, `web/service/`). None of these exist in this repo. The skill provides zero value here and would cause confusion.

    3. **`.claude/MULTI_TENANT_GUIDE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`** — This was a one-time cleanup task prompt listing 5 tasks (delete demo pages, fix role mapping, etc.). All tasks described in it are COMPLETE (Phase 1 of this milestone). It is not a reference guide; it is an expired task list.

    Do NOT delete:
    - `.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/` — generic but useful UI/UX reference
    - `.claude/skills/docs-explorer/` — relevant to this project's stack
    - `.claude/skills/frontend-aesthetics/` — general aesthetics guidance (harmless)
    - `.claude/skills/frontend-tailwind/` — aligns with project's Tailwind stack
    - `.claude/FRONTEND_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` — comprehensive spec, still useful as reference
    - `.claude/PLAYWRIGHT_TEST_GUIDE.md` — testing guide, still useful
    - `.claude/mimshak-export-upgrade-prompt (1).md` — needed for future v2 export work (EXP-01/02)

    Create the audit report at the specified path. The report must document:

    **Section 1: Files Audited** — Complete inventory of every file under `.claude/` and `.agents/` with its purpose and verdict (keep/delete/fix).

    **Section 2: Findings** — Organized by category:
    - **Duplicates found:** `.agents/` was exact copy of `.claude/skills/` subset
    - **Wrong-project content:** component-refactoring skill was for Dify, not Tenuto.io
    - **Expired task prompts:** MULTI_TENANT_GUIDE_IMPLEMENTATION.md (work complete)
    - **Stale documentation:** CLAUDE.md (F3-F6 marked incomplete), PROJECT.md (wrong backend path, stale constraints), REQUIREMENTS.md (all marked Pending), ROADMAP.md (no completion markers), MEMORY.md (duplicates STATE.md progress tracking)
    - **Settings bloat:** settings.local.json has stale additionalDirectories and many duplicate permission entries

    **Section 3: Actions Taken** (this plan) — Deletions performed.

    **Section 4: Actions Pending** (Plan 02) — Documentation fixes.

    **Section 5: Verifiable Criteria** — Pass/fail checklist:
    - [ ] No duplicate files between .agents/ and .claude/skills/
    - [ ] No skills reference wrong project (Dify)
    - [ ] No completed one-time prompts in .claude/
    - [ ] CLAUDE.md has no stale checkboxes (F3-F6 marked complete)
    - [ ] PROJECT.md has correct backend path
    - [ ] REQUIREMENTS.md traceability shows completed phases
    - [ ] MEMORY.md does not duplicate STATE.md progress tracking
    - [ ] Architecture document exists at .claude/ARCHITECTURE.md
